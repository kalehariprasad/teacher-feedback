He has produced an audience-friendly and interesting pop-up book by exploring various designs to incorporate into his work, although his pop-ups could have been relevant to the storyline. Arnold Hammilton has used thinking skills to overcome challenges and often reflected on the process of his project. In Unit 2, Arnold Hammilton has demonstrated substantial understanding of colours and has applied his knowledge to create the colour wheel. He has also explored the characteristics of pop art and some of the famous artworks and presented his findings. To further improve, Arnold Hammilton is encouraged to read the teacher's instructions more thoroughly to meet all the requirements for class activities.\"\n",

They have actively participated in various exercises aimed at developing proper mechanics for overhand throwing. These activities encompassed partner exercises and team games such as Handball, Tchoukball, and Pylon Ball. Students have taken the initiative to identify specific areas for improvement in their throwing or catching abilities and have devised plans to enhance these skills. Additionally, they have identified strategies to improve teamwork and have provided summaries of their personal and team performance throughout this unit. In the aquatic setting, students have concentrated on acquiring the necessary skills for engaging in Water Polo and Swimming activities. They have received instruction on the rules of Water Polo and their practical application in game situations. Skills such as passing, catching, and shooting in Water Polo have been emphasized. Furthermore, the students have focused on kicking techniques, stroke correction, treading water, and consolidating their proficiency in Front crawl kicking and stroke techniques.\",\n",
